              Hello, I'm <strong>Reet Priye</strong>, a Full Stack Developer currently working at 
              <strong> Tata Consultancy Services</strong>. I have <strong>2 years of experience</strong> 
              building scalable, enterprise-grade web applications using technologies like 
              <strong> React, Java, Spring Boot</strong>, and DevOps tools including 
              <strong> Docker, Kubernetes</strong>, and CI/CD pipelines.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and solving complex problemsâ€”
              demonstrated by solving <strong>1000+ DSA problems</strong> on LeetCode and earning the 
              <strong> Knight Badge</strong>. My work currently supports a leading German multinational 
              bank, where I contribute to critical systems used by hundreds of business clients.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm always looking to learn new technologies, collaborate on impactful projects, and create 
              solutions that address real-world problems. If you'd like to connect, discuss opportunities,
